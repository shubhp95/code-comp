FAUST: THE QUICK PATH FROM IDEAS TO EFFICIENT DSP
Faust online compiler V2.0

This package has been automatically generated by the Faust online compiler (http://faust.grame.fr/index.php/online-example). It makes it possible to compile the Faust code edited in the online compiler as an executable file without having Faust installed on your computer. It contains the .dsp file edited in the "Faust Code" tab, the .cpp file generated during the Faust compilation, all the required C++ header files and a Makefile. Also, some other elements might complete this package in function of the selected architecture (for example, if the PureData architecture is used, the file generated by faust2pd will be added to the package). 

It is assumed that all the dependencies related to the selected architecture and required for the c++ compilation to work are correctly installed on you system. If you checked the "OSC" option, you'll also need to have Faust properly installed.

To generate the executable file just type: 
   make binary 

If you wish to clean the folder from all the generated files generated during the C++ compilation process, run:
   make clean

If you have a look at the Makefile, you'll see that a few other options are available. These options need Faust to be installed on your system and shouldn't be used with this package.
