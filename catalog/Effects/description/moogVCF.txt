Moog "Voltage Controlled Filter" (VCF) in "analog" form<br>
Moog VCF implemented using the same logical block diagram as the classic analog circuit.  As such, it neglects the one-sample delay associated with the feedback path around the four one-poles. This extra delay alters the response, especially at high frequencies<br>
