This function allows you to change the pitch of a signal. The pitch variation is expressed in semitones. pitch-shifter fragments the signal into small chunks stocked in buffers, and then reads those chunks faster or slower respectively to obtain higher or lower pitch. Besides, two buffers reading decayed chunks are crossfaded to smooth the signal.
