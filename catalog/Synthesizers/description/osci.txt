The function osci generates a sinusoidal signal at the frequency indicated by the slider. Frequencies from 0Hz up to 24000Hz can be generated. You can also choose the volume of the signal.This oscillator performs approximations of the sin function using linear interpolations, which are more precise than the approximations used in the osc function.
