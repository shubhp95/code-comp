This class implements a hybrid digital waveguide instrument that can generate a variety of wind-like sounds.  It has also been referred to as the blowed string model. The waveguide section is essentially that of a string, with one rigid and one lossy termination.  The non-linear function is a reed table. The string can be blown at any point between the terminations, though just as with strings, it is impossible to excite the system at either end. If the excitation is placed at the string mid-point, the sound is that of a clarinet.  At points closer to the bridge, the sound is closer to that of a saxophone.  See Scavone (2002) for more details.
